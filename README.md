## Hello everyone, welcome to my profile ðŸ‘‹
### That's a tiny description of me.
My name is Roberto Junior. I am a full-stack developer and a Computer science student based at BelÃ©m/PA. I have been studying IT since 2014. Around that road of learning, I had joyned into the college, opened my own company, worked as a mobile Developer, joined the Fluency Academy team as a Fullstack Developer, and started more than 50 projects. Moreover, I hope to grow every day and contribute to how many Impacting projects I can. Feel free to reach me and ask me about anything ðŸ¤Ÿ.

#### Some considerations:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a FullStack Developer at Fluency Academy
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Elixir, Typescript, and JavaScript.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Javascript and Typescript projects
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: send me an email ðŸ‘‰ robertojuniordev@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: The best way to don't get bugs in your code is don't coding ðŸ§
